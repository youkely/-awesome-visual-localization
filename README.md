# Awesome Visual Localization

A literature review on the research of visual localization, i.e. estimate the 6 dof pose of an image given a representation of the world created using a set of reference images. The representation can be a 3D reconstruction, a set of images with poses tagged or a deep neural network.

Main challenges for current methods consists of
- Illumination changes
- Dynamic scenes with moving objects
- Long-time period with different seasons
- Occlusion of the scene by an object or person
- Strong viewpoint difference
